This site was created using create-react-app --use-npm and it was styled with styled components. It's a single page site that has only a to do list on it. 

I used a reducer to set up the initial state and built out my action cases. The cases were to add an item to the list, to mark an item as completed, and to erase the completed items by pressing a button.
